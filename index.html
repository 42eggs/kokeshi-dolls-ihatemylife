          Japan is known for celebrating all things adorable. The country’s kawaii culture is believed to have begun
          after World War II, when famously cute characters adorned countless products.<br>
          <br>However, Japan’s affection for lovable figures actually dates back to the 1800s. Kokeshi are traditional
          wooden dolls that were first made by craftsmen during the end of the Edo period; and
          today, they’re celebrated icons of Japanese folk art.

          Kokeshi are 'created' by artists and craftspeople, and have features and styles unique to their own
          particular artist, craftsperson, local culture and region. The majority of Traditional Kokeshi come from the
          Tohoku region, while Creative, (Sosaku), Kokeshi were, and are, primarily made in Gunma prefecture.
          <br><br>Mingei Arts' collection of Traditional and Creative antique Kokeshi dolls were acquired beginning in
          1998 after numerous visits to the wood carvers’ studios, associated retail shops, and onsens. As long time
          researchers and collectors of Japanese folk art we have found that Kokeshi and Kokeshi inspired toys
          continue to imbue a spiritual significance from their original beginnings.

          <h1 class="content-header">History</h1><br>
          The art of kokeshi originates from the hot spring mountain villages in the Tōhoku region of northeastern
          Japan. The first examples of kokeshi appeared during the end of the Edo period (1603-1868 CE), when
          craftsmen would make the simple wooden forms as toys for children. With long, limbless bodies and enlarged
          heads, the dolls gradually evolved to feature painted facial expressions and colorful kimonos.
          <br><br>All six prefectures in the Tōhoku region—Aomori, Akita, Iwate, Miyagi, Yamagata, and Fukushima—have
          a history of kokeshi making. Each town has its own specific way of crafting and decorating them, making each
          of the 12 styles easily identifiable. With the arrival of the Meiji period in the 1860s, tourists began
          traveling to the mountains to enjoy the natural hot springs.

          Over the years they have become increasingly popular worldwide, especially amongst shinnichi (Japanophiles)
          and collectors.
          Kokeshi doll making has now come to be recognised as one of Japan's most vibrant folk arts.
          <br><br>Traditionally comprising a simple trunk and enlarged head with a few thin, painted lines for detail,
          kokeshi designs have become increasingly intricate, diverse and faithful to the human form over the years,
          resulting in the attractive and relatively lifelike dolls you see today. Contemporary interpretations of
          kokeshi are of a more rounded shape than their traditional counterparts, with richer colours and a greater
          emphasis on the facial features. They are often themed to celebrate a special occasion, reflect a hobby or
          profession, or emulate a fictional character, making them work particularly well as gifts.
          <br><br>They were created to satisfy the desire of children to have something with which they could play as
          well as incorporating historical elements that parents wanted to pass on to their children.
          For a doll reduced to its simplest form, there are a wonderful range of variations on the
          spherical/cylindrical theme produced by the artists, with very distinctive facial features, head and body
          shapes, and painted patterns. These variations reflect the styles of the six different prefectures and the
          ten/eleven families historically associated with the making of these traditional Kokeshi wooden dolls.

          <h1 class="content-header">Spiritual Significance</h1><br>
          Opinions vary greatly regarding the meaning of kokeshi dolls and their spiritual significance. Most
          interpretations are centred around children, with some believing that kokeshi represent the wish for a
          healthy child, and others that they bring children closer to the mountain spirits. Many people also agree
          that they were originally exchanged as tokens of friendship, with messages concealed within.
          <br><br>Every September, a kokeshi doll festival is held in Naruko, in which unwanted kokeshi are put on a
          pyre and burned.

            One of the rarest kokeshi styles comes from Hijiori Onsen in Yamagata, where there is only one master
            kokeshi maker. Hijiori dolls feature happy-looking eyes with double lids, as well as eyebrows, a nose, and
            tiny red lips.
            <br><br>Their bodies are also decorated with chrysanthemums, but they sometimes feature a “spray” formation
            of flowers. The color yellow is frequently used to paint the background of the body; and in some instances,
            maple leaves will also be incorporated.

            pink blush, and flared nostrils—was officially recognized as the 12th authentic style in 2018. One of the

            In Nakanosawa Onsen in Fukushima, the unmistakable Nakanosawa kokeshi—characterized by wide almond eyes,
            pink blush, and flared nostrils—was officially recognized as the 12th authentic style in 2018. One of the

            <br><br>These dolls also have been given the humorous name of “Tako Bozo,” which translates as “an octopus
            with a monk’s shaven head.”
            <br><br>After Japan gave access to Western ideas, many Creative Kokeshi artists wanted to honor the carving
            tradition, but did not want to follow traditional family designs. The Japanese use the term ‘Mottainai’,
            which was originally a Buddhist word that referred to the “essence of things.” Applied to everything in the
            physical universe, the word suggests that objects do not exist in isolation but are intrinsically linked to
            one another.
            <br>‘Mottainai’ is also an expression of sadness for the disrespect that is shown when any living or
            non-living entity is wasted. Thus we find the Sosaku artists focusing on a new visual approach to the
            creation of the Kokeshi doll, reinforcing of the important part that forests play in the daily life of the
            people.
            <br><br>>The images represented in Japanese Sosaku Kokeshi carving typically fall into one of three
            categories: iconic scenes, significant themes and motifs in history and literature, and objects in everyday
            life, (e.g. kimono/yukata, children/baby, seasonal grasses/flowers).
            <br><br>Additionally, the seasons have been celebrated in Japan for centuries, and have influenced design on
            all forms of art produced in that country. Kokeshi dolls are certainly no exception, as seasonal motifs and
            mythological subjects are carved and painted in a variety of methods on their bodies.
